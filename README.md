A browser based game as a learning exercise for the Online Course that I have been following on Vue.js. (https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/)

This is the first project that is introduced in the course and covers some of the basic features and functionalities of Vue.js. 

For an improved version of the same project (SAI, Components), you can check https://github.com/berk245/dragon-slayer-with-components .
